## Welcome!
Welcome to my homepage! I originally attempted to set up my personal website
either with Jekyll or Hexo, yet both failed to satisfy my need. Thus,
I eventually selected React to do the job.

## Tools Used
*React* (I have recently also tried Angular though)  
*Redux* (Not too complex, simple)  
*Bootstrap* (I got tired with CSS halfway: you'll notice tons of inline
CSS. I know it is definitely bad practice but LOL... Okay, I should also use Sass next time...)  
*MySQL* (Okay I know I should try MongoDB... But I am just getting lazy again)  
*Express* (Should consider to give Golang a shot, but that's for another day)  
*WebSocket* (I don't know why I want to write a ChatRoom...)

## Packages Created  
*express-comment* (package I developed to host comments)  

## Blog
Old blogs from [expr.IO](http://expr.io) has been migrated here! Woo-hoo!
