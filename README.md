# KSM.sh, Homepage of Kevin Qian
Available [here](http://ksm.sh). Please visit under Chrome/Safari/Firefox
(under edge, for some reason (probably related to React-Router issues) the site would NOT
render...)

## Welcome!
Welcome to my homepage! I originally attempted to set up my personal website
either with Jekyll or Hexo, yet both failed to satisfy my need. Thus,
I eventually selected React to do the job.

## Tools Used
React, Bootstrap (I got tired with CSS halfway: you'll notice tons of inline
CSS. I know it is definitely bad practice but LOL...)

## Blog
Well, since I haven't yet set up the server for blog yet (and not in the near
future planning to since I hardly write anything worthwhile to be published),
I temporarily dropped an article at [expr.IO](http://expr.io).
